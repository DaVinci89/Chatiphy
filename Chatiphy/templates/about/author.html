        <p><b>Hello everyone!</b></p>
        <i><p>My name is Igor Olkhin, and I am the pioneer and founder of Chatiphy, a social network for bloggers.</p>
        <p> This project is the first of many ideas and is the beginning of my journey as a web developer. I am sure that this wonderful platform will find positive feedback in the hearts of users, and will definitely find its audience. The functionality will be constantly updated as I study new technologies and programming.</p>
        <p>A few words about me.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of experience in the field of programming, in particular the Python language, and I try to learn everything that comes my way. Probably, every programmer will understand this feeling when you create something from nothing. When a miracle is formed from a few obscure sets of symbols - whether it is an application, a web resource, or a console game of tic-tac-toe. This is what inspires me the most - creation.</p>
        <p>Of course, without the support of people close to me, all my efforts would be in vain.</p>
        <p>First of all, I would like to thank a wonderful girl and the love of my life - <b>Evgenia</b>.
        Also, a special thank you to our cat <b>Basia</b>, who acted as an antidepressant and "rubber duck" for me.</p>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Chatiphy</strong>, and may your experience, like my work on the project, be interesting, useful and enjoyable.</p></i>
